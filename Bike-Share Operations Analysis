Bike-Share Operations & Growth Analysis (BigQuery SQL Project)

Project Overview
This project analyzes a bike-sharing dataset using SQL in Google BigQuery to understand ride behavior, station performance, and user growth trends.
The analysis is designed from an operations and strategy perspective, focusing on insights that can support capacity planning, service optimization, and growth monitoring.


Objective of the Analysis

The objective of this analysis is to provide data-driven insights that help a bike-share operator:
	•	Identify peak usage periods to support operational planning
	•	Understand customer behavior across membership types
	•	Detect high-demand and imbalanced stations for bike rebalancing
	•	Monitor service quality and data reliability
	•	Track user growth trends over time

The analysis is fully implemented in SQL and structured to reflect a real-world analytical workflow.


Dataset Description

The project uses three core tables:
	•	Rides – Trip-level data including start/end stations, timestamps, distance, and duration
	•	Stations – Station identifiers and station names
	•	Users – User profiles including membership level and signup date


Key Business Questions
	1.	How large is the system in terms of rides, users, and stations?
	2.	Are there data quality issues that could affect decision-making?
	3.	What does a typical ride look like in distance and duration?
	4.	How do membership types differ in usage behavior?
	5.	When are peak demand hours during the day?
	6.	Which stations generate the highest ride activity?
	7.	Are bikes flowing into or out of specific stations, indicating rebalancing needs?
	8.	Is the user base growing month-over-month, and at what rate?
